      <description>I finally worked out the MIME type bug I was having with IPFS. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll relaunch my website soon!
Rhys got a pretty nice haircut today.
He and Andrea went to baseball practice, and Corbin and I went on a long bike ride: Cadman park, then down the hill, past the karate dojo, all the way to Costco. We got a berry smoothie and ice cream, then walked back up the hill, and went home.</description>

      <description>I bought Corbin the Kurzgesagt gratitude journal for his birthday and I wanted to practice doing it with him. Here&amp;rsquo;s my entry for today:
Q: What happened today?
I had a hanger-induced lunchistetial crisis.
I went to Woody&amp;rsquo;s at Pacific Beach
I started reading the US Sailing Basic Cruising book
Q: Did something good happen to you?
I had a peaceful lunch at Woody&amp;rsquo;s - beautiful weather, great view right on the beach, cool weird surf music, stoic servers.</description>
