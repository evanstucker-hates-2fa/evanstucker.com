# We have to set baseURL to '' so that all links are relative (ie.
# "/posts/new-mobile-phone-plan" instead of
# "http://ipfs.evanstucker.com/posts/new-mobile-phone-plan/"), otherwise this
# site will only work if accessed through ipfs.evanstucker.com, and we don't
# want that. We want anyone with this static content to be able to view it.
baseURL: ''

# Need to use `relativeURLs: true` to fix this error:
# The resource from blahblah.css was blocked due to MIME type (“text/plain”) mismatch (X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff).
relativeURLs: true

# Not sure if this is desirable or not, but leaving it here so I remember to read more about it later.
