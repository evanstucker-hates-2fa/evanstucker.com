## Remote

Transactions can occur over a network.

## Irreversible

Transactions can not be reverted by the system. If you want a refund, you must ask the payee for it - there is no higher authority that you can appeal to.

## Permissionless

The system can be used by anyone without permission from any other entity.

## Decentralized

There is no central person or organization that controls the system.

## Private

Only the payer knows the payee and amount.

## Offline

Transactions can occur while not connected to any network.

## Approximate Time to First Confirmation (~TtFC)

Number of seconds before a transaction is confirmed by the network.

## Approximate Total Fee

Equivalent USD amount charged to make a transaction. This includes fees payed by the payer *and* the payee - the total fee to use the payment system.

- Crypto average transaction fees are from https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#3m
- Cash App: asked AI, because their website doesn't work with VPN.
- Paypal: https://www.paypal.com/us/business/paypal-business-fees
- Venmo: https://venmo.com/resources/our-fees/
- Credit cards: https://www.fool.com/money/research/average-credit-card-processing-fees-costs-america/

## Energy

The kilowatt hours (kWh) of energy needed to make a 10,000 transactions. I asked AI, so these numbers are only slightly more trustworthy than random numbers.

## TODO

- Add ACH, Wire, Western Union, gold, ammo, cans of beans, and any other systems you can think of.
- Add a column for final settlement time (use correct terminology?). When someone pays you in Zcash, you can turn around and spend it almost immediately. When someone pays you with a credit card, you don't see the money in your bank account for like 24-48 hours.
- Something something fungible.
- Publish this on Wikipedia instead of my little nothing of a website.
