1. A private transaction is one where the sender, recipient, and amount are known only by the sender and recipient.

2. Permissionless systems can be used by anyone without permission. Anyone can create an account, and no one can block transactions.

3. Irreversible transactions can not be undone by the system. If you want a refund, you must ask the recipient for it - there is no other authority that you can appeal to.
