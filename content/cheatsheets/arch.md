You need to comment out the "Added by Evans" sections of resolved.conf:
```
sudo vim /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
```
Then restart systemd-resolved:
```
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved.service 
```
Don't forget to undo this when you're off the horrible network.

# Enable DNSSEC and DNS over TLS

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-resolved#DNS_over_TLS

1. Start and enable systemd-resolved:
   ```
   sudo systemctl enable systemd-resolved.service
   sudo systemctl start systemd-resolved.service
   ```
1. Provide domain name resolution for software that reads /etc/resolv.conf directly:
   ```
   ln -sf ../run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
   ```
1. Enable experimental DNSSEC, by creating /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/dnssec.conf:
   ```
   [Resolve]
   DNSSEC=true
   ```
1. Enable DNS over TLS by creating /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/dns_over_tls.conf:
   ```
   [Resolve]
   DNS=9.9.9.9#dns.quad9.net 149.112.112.112#dns.quad9.net 2620:fe::fe#dns.quad9.net 2620:fe::9#dns.quad9.net
   DNSOverTLS=yes
   Domains=~.
   ```
