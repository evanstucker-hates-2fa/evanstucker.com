I've always had eclectic taste, but I'm really enjoying wrecking Netflix's (and other streaming services) recommendation engine lately. It appears to have no idea what I am anymore. I typically watch weird indie movies and random shows from 2 to 10 years ago on my account, but I also watch a bunch of stuff with the kids - we just finished Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts (it was decent). And I occationally watch blockbuster movies with Andrea, or family movies. We watched the new Cowboy Bebop live action series, and it started recommending anime. I tried to watch Attack on Titan, but couldn't stand it. Despite that, I now have a whole section for anime in my Netflix suggestions. I've also just started watching some Bollywood stuff. I put a lot of effort into breaking out of the tiny little bubble of content it typically recommends. It's meta-entertain for me I guess - trying to confuse the rec-engine AI - there's a surprising amount of stuff on Netflix, but once it puts you in a box, you only ever see a tiny sliver of the content on the platform. Pretty disappointing. I wish there was an anti-recommendation-engine - an option for you to just tell it to show you something completely new and different. I would love that.
