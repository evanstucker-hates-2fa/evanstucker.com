I bought Corbin the [Kurzgesagt gratitude journal](https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org/collections/notebooks-journals/products/gratitude-journal?variant=32410837352496) for his birthday and I wanted to practice doing it with him. Here's my entry for today:

Q: What happened today?

I had a hanger-induced lunchistetial crisis.

I went to Woody's at Pacific Beach

I started reading the US Sailing Basic Cruising book

Q: Did something good happen to you?

I had a peaceful lunch at Woody's - beautiful weather, great view right on the beach, cool weird surf music, stoic servers. Nice lunch.

Andrea made us delicious wings for dinner.

I learned some new things about marine diesel motors.

Q: What could you be grateful for, today?

I'm grateful for good food, our amazing location, and learning new things.
