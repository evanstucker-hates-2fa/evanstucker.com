I 100% agree with https://dropwww.com/why. TL;DR: the "www." prefix is completely unnecessary, adds 10 syllables when you speak the URL, takes longer to type, uses up more space in the address bar, etc. Also, as a DevSecOps Engineer, I just don't want to manage extra endpoints, certificates, forwarding, and DNS records for the extra "www." URL.
