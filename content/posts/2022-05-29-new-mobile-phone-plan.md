I got a new Pinephone Pro earlier this year, and I've been meaning to find an inexpensive mobile phone plan with minimal data . I didn't want to add this phone to my existing Google Fi account, because I'm trying to de-Google myself, and it seems counterproductive to give Google *more* money if my goal is to stop being their customer. In my research, I found a fantastic Reddit community named "NoContract" whose goal is to "Reclaim your freedom -- and your wallet! Ditch your cellular contract today!" This post in particular was really helpful:

As usual, I spent far too long going through this data and trying to decide what I care about most. I ended up getting a $5/month plan with https://hellomobile.com/ that will give me a unlimited talk and text and 500MB of data! Amazing!
