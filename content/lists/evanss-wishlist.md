Locksport things
- [Genesis Lockpick Set $25](https://covertinstruments.com/collections/lockpicks/products/genesis-lock-pick) and/or [Covert Companion $90](https://covertinstruments.com/collections/ssf-bypass-bible/products/covert-companion-fully-loaded)
- Optional [Comb picks $15](https://lockpicktools.com/slotted-titanium-pocket-comb-4-5-pin/) - not necessary if I get the Covert Companion.
- Optional [CI Practice Lock $50](https://covertinstruments.com/collections/training-gear/products/ci-practice-lock), but I also have plenty of locks to mess with at home too.

Musical Instruments
- [Teenage Engineering Pocket Operator PO-35 Speak $100](https://teenage.engineering/products/po/metal) - this thing is super cool, but complicated, but I really want to learn how to do synth and patterns and stuff!
- [Tongue Drum $155](https://unlaxmusicstore.com/collections/our-instruments/products/theoriginaldrum2) - this thing is super cool and easy and sounds cool.
- a cheap, used [electric guitar or bass ~$150](https://sandiego.craigslist.org/search/msa?sort=priceasc&query=electric%20guitar%7Cbass) and [amplifier ~$100](https://sandiego.craigslist.org/search/msa?query=guitar%7Cbass+amp&sort=priceasc&min_price=&max_price=)
- [Stylophone Gen-X1 $70](https://dubreq.com/product/stylophone-gen-x-1/)

Games/Toys
- [Trogdor! The Board Game (unavailable?)](https://trogdorboardgame.homestarrunner.com/)
- [Set card game $13](https://www.setgame.com/set)

Nature
- a [bird feeder camera](https://www.seabirdsanctuary.org/bird-feeder-camera/)? They seem too expensive and poorly rated. Maybe a "trail camera" or a used gopro that can do motion detection photos or maybe just an android app that can do motion detection capture that I can install on an extra phone? I dunno. More research needed...

Consumables
- [Red Star Hot sauce $8](https://www.plownpepper.com/shop/p/64sh4l9oyuenkcp908jdpmed48acr5)
