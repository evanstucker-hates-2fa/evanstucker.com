Artists
- [Christine Hausserman](https://www.christinehausserman.com/) uses specialty coated glass beads and pieces to create stunning mosaics.
- [Courtney Scruggs](https://whatknotstudios.com/) creates gorgeous, terrifying bronze scultures with a strong nautical style.
- [Elisabeth Hale](https://www.ehalegallery.com/) makes amazing, beautifully textured paintings of inspiring landscapes like the Grand Canyon, Arches National Park, and various coastal scenes.
- [Grant Pecoff](https://pecoff.com/) has mastered the art of painting water and beautiful beach scenes from all over the world. He has a very clean, minimalistic style that's really appealing to me.
- [Ian Strom](https://www.instagram.com/glass.by.en/) makes amazing handblown borosilicate glass creations.
- [Jeni Bate](https://skyscapesforthesoul.com/) takes circles, triangles, or other-shaped cuts and arranges them on airy skyscapes.
- [Jerry Clovis](https://jerryclovis.com/) has large gradient paintings that have really vibrant colors.
- [Lee Hendrickson](https://photographyofcrystals.com/) takes amazing photographs of microscopic crystals.
- [Lisa Bryson](https://lbryson.com/) has fascinating portraits - despite their rough appearance they seem to convey an amazing amount of detail. The style is really appealing to me. I kind of wish I could commission a family portrait by her...
- [Margaret L. Gonzales](https://www.bluepearlartstudio.com/) has some beautiful ocean scenes with neon colors.
- [Nobe](http://nobeart.com/) has delightful sculptures - some are whimsical, some have a really unique style, all were great.
- [Patrick DeAngelis](https://www.patrickdeangelisart.com/) surprises me. I don't like Rothko, and DeAngelis appears to have gone done a similar path, but where Rothko fell flat, DeAngelis has creating mesmerizing fields of soft color and light.
- [Raymond Francis John](https://raymondfrancisjohn.com/) creates colorful, alluring digital designs.
- [Tali Lopez](https://talilopez.com/) draws freaky little people with lovely and/or irreverent messages, haha.
- [Yves Goyatton](https://www.yvesgoyatton.com/) has some interesting sculpture - mostly truncated figures with brutalist elements or transparent sections.

Galleries
- [Moryork](https://moryork.com/) has a collection of some of the most bizarre objects I've ever seen. I stumbled upon it when I was walking down the street in Highland Park, California. If you're ever in the area, definitely check it out!
