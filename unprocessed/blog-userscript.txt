Userscripts

According to the [userscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) Wikipedia article, "a userscript (or user script) is a program, usually written in JavaScript, for modifying web pages to augment browsing." I actually need a userscript to make Wikipedia better. I love Wikipedia, but I'm annoyed that you can't filter their tables. I've been waiting years for this feature, but it seems like it's never going to happen. Luckily, there are other people out there who are impatient, who also happen to be handy with JavaScript! So, let's install a userscript manager, and find a script that will allow us to filter tables in Wikipedia!

Here are my requirements:

* must be free open source software
* must work with Firefox
* must be actively maintained (updated within the last year)

When I search for "userscript", the [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/) is the most popular result. According to that website, there are three userscript managers available for Firefox: Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, and Violentmonkey.

* [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) was last updated 2 years ago (Jan 27, 2021), so it's out.
* [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) license is "All rights reserved", and is no longer open source.
* [Violentmonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/) looks like the clear winner for me, so I'm installing it.

The [Wikitable filter](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/10683-wikitable-filter) userscript appears to be the only option. It's not ideal, because it hasn't been updated since Feb 2017... Oh well, beggars can't be choosers. I installed it, and... it doesn't work.

OK... well... Here's an even older script from 2012 called [Wikipedia Table filter](https://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/137939). Let's try it... I ended up having to edit it. I changed:
```
// @include        http://*.wikipedia.org/wiki/*
```
to 
```
// @include        https://*.wikipedia.org/wiki/*
```
and it worked! Sort of... After using it, it's not really what I'm looking for either.

Well, this is an unsatisfying conclusion...
