# The Importance of Self-hosting, Free Open Source Software, and Cloud Agnosticism to the Decentralization Movement

The movement for [decentralization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization) is not new. We've been talking about it since the mid-1800s.

[Web3](https://ethereum.org/en/web3/#what-is-web3) uses blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs to give power back to the users in the form of ownership. ...a few core principles guide its creation.

* Web3 is decentralized: instead of large swathes of the internet controlled and owned by centralized entities, ownership gets distributed amongst its builders and users.
* Web3 is permissionless: everyone has equal access to participate in Web3, and no one gets excluded.
* Web3 has native payments: it uses cryptocurrency for spending and sending money online instead of relying on the outdated infrastructure of banks and payment processors.
* Web3 is trustless: it operates using incentives and economic mechanisms instead of relying on trusted third-parties.

[Permissionless](https://permission.io/blog/permissioned-vs-permissionless-blockchain/) blockchain networks completely lack access controls. As a result, neither normal users nor validators have to verify their identities or submit Know Your Customer (KYC) documents to join. Instead, they can participate in the network while staying anonymous or pseudonymous.

[Free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer.” We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis. You may have paid money to get copies of a free program, or you may have obtained copies at no charge. But regardless of how you got your copies, you always have the freedom to copy and change the software, even to sell copies.

[Trustless](https://www.preethikasireddy.com/post/what-do-we-mean-by-blockchains-are-trustless) means that there are mechanisms in place by which all parties in the system can reach a consensus on what the canonical truth is. Power and trust is distributed (or shared) among the network’s stakeholders (e.g. developers, miners, and consumers), rather than concentrated in a single individual or entity (e.g. banks, governments, and financial institutions).

[Antifragile](https://fs.blog/antifragile-a-definition/) things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure , risk, and uncertainty. Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better. This property is behind everything that has changed with time: evolution, culture, ideas, revolutions, political systems, technological innovation, cultural and economic success, corporate survival, good recipes (say, chicken soup or steak tartare with a drop of cognac), the rise of cities, cultures, legal systems, equatorial forests, bacterial resistance … even our own existence as a species on this planet.

## Self-hosting vs Managed Services

[Self-hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_\(web_services\)) is the practice of running and maintaining a website or service using a private web server, instead of using a service outside of someone's own control. Self-hosting can be [on-premises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-premises_software) on your own hardware, or it could be on a virtual private server in the cloud.

[Managed services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_services) is the practice of outsourcing the responsibility for maintaining, and anticipating need for, a range of processes and functions, ostensibly for the purpose of improved operations and reduced budgetary expenditures through the reduction of directly-employed staff.

[Software as a service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) (SaaS) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. With SaaSS, the users do not have even the executable file that does their computing: it is on someone else's server, where the users can't see or touch it. Thus it is impossible for them to ascertain what it really does, and impossible to change it.

OpenSaaS refers to software as a service (SaaS) based on open-source code.

## Free Open Source Software vs Closed Source Software

github -> gitlab -> codeberg -> gitea -> radicle.xyz

GitHub: closed source, managed service, owned by Microsoft.

GitLab: open source, managed service or self-hosted.
